# 💡 Project Idea: Streaming Music Intelligence

## Inspiration

The rapid growth of music streaming platforms like Spotify and YouTube
has transformed how audiences consume music.\
This project was inspired by the need to convert vast volumes of
streaming data into meaningful insights that support better
decision-making for artists, labels, and platforms.

## Core Concept

Streaming Music Intelligence focuses on analyzing music performance and
listener engagement using exploratory data analysis (EDA).\
The goal is to understand how audio features, album types, and platforms
influence popularity and streaming success.

## Key Questions Addressed

-   Which streaming platform dominates user engagement?
-   Do albums, singles, or compilations perform better?
-   How do audio attributes like energy and danceability impact streams?
-   Does having an official video increase views and likes?
-   Which artists consistently perform well across platforms?

## Analytical Approach

1.  Data cleaning and preprocessing\
2.  Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)\
3.  Feature comparison and aggregation\
4.  Dashboard creation for insights visualization\
5.  Interpretation of patterns and trends

## Why This Project Matters

This project demonstrates how raw entertainment data can be transformed
into business intelligence, making it ideal for real-world analytics use
cases.

## Outcome

An interactive dashboard supported by strong EDA that provides clear,
actionable insights into streaming music performance.
